The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. Since its emergence in Asia late last year, the virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica. Cases are rising daily in Africa the Americas, and Europe. Countries are racing to slow the spread of the disease by testing and treating patients, carrying out contact tracing, limiting travel, quarantining citizens, and cancelling large gatherings such as sporting events, concerts, and schools.
The pandemic is moving like a wave—one that may yet crash on those least able to cope.
But COVID-19 is much more than a health crisis. By stressing every one of the countries it touches, it has the potential to create devastating social, economic and political crises that will leave deep scars.
We are in uncharted territory. Many of our communities are unrecognizable from even a week ago. Dozens of the world’s greatest cities are deserted as people stay indoors, either by choice or by government order. Across the world, shops, theatres, restaurants and bars are closing.
Every day, people are losing jobs and income, with no way of knowing when normality will return. Small island nations, heavily dependent on tourism, have empty hotels and deserted beaches. The International Labour Organization estimates that 25 million jobs could be lost.''',

        '''The first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China.The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event.Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market, it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market. However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.A March 2021 WHO-convened report stated that human spillover via an intermediate animal host was the most likely explanation, with direct spillover from bats next most likely. Introduction through the food supply chain and the Huanan Seafood Market was considered another possible, but less likely, explanation.An analysis in November 2021, however, said that the earliest-known case had been misidentified and that the preponderance of early cases linked to the Huanan Market argued for it being the source.

For a virus recently acquired through a cross-species transmission, rapid evolution is expected. The mutation rate estimated from early cases of SARS-CoV-2 was of 6.54×10−4 per site per year. Coronaviruses in general have high genetic plasticity, but SARS-CoV-2's viral evolution is slowed by the RNA proofreading capability of its replication machinery.For comparison, the viral mutation rate in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be lower than that of influenza.

Research into the natural reservoir of the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak has resulted in the discovery of many SARS-like bat coronaviruses, most originating in horseshoe bats. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that samples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus show a resemblance of 80% to SARS‑CoV‑2. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96.1% resemblance to SARS‑CoV‑2. This sequence was the closest known to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of its identification,  but it is not its direct ancestor.  Other closely-related sequences were also identified in samples from local bat populations.''',

    description: '''First COVID-19 infections in the Philippines:
a case report, One possible explanation for the differing clinical
courses is the presence of co-infection. In both patients,
the real-time PCR detection panel was reported to be
positive for multiple pathogens. The Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae detected in patient 1
most likely represent bacterial colonisation, and it is unclear to what extent her presentation was due to influenza or COVID-19 or both. Patient 2 tested positive for
COVID-19, Influenza B, and Streptococcus pneumoniae,
all of which can cause respiratory infection and severe
pneumonia. Unfortunately, sputum culture was not possible due to biosafety concerns. It is unclear which
pathogen was the leading cause of death, but previous
research has shown that outcomes of acute viral respiratory infection are worse if multiple pathogens are
present . This highlights the importance of testing for
other respiratory pathogens in addition to COVID-19 in
order to optimise antimicrobial therapy.
Patient 2 developed increasing dyspnoea on day 11 of
illness, similar to the first COVID-19 case in the USA,
where mild symptoms were initially reported with progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness . The median time from illness onset to dyspnoea in a case series in
Wuhan was 8 days (range 5–13) . The explanation for
patient 2’s worsening condition and development of
haemoptysis was progression of pneumonia rather than
acute respiratory distress syndrome or pulmonary embolism, but it was not possible to perform a CT scan, additional laboratory tests or an autopsy to further assess this.
Although he was treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, it is not clear if the outcome would have been better
in a high-resource setting. Both patients were treated with
oseltamivir in view of positive results for Influenza B. Further studies are required to establish the optimal treatment and role of antiviral medication for patients with
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.
Our cases contrast with the US case in terms of the
relative paucity of lab data and time to receive results.
Limited in-house testing was undertaken due to biosafety concerns. In the case of patient 2, the diagnosis of
COVID-19 was not made until a day before the patient
died''',

    description:
        '''The first US COVID-19 death might have occurred in California on 6 February — three weeks before the first reported death, in Washington state.

After autopsies, three people who died in Santa Clara County between 6 February and 6 March have been confirmed as having died of COVID-19, according to a statement released by the county’s department of public health on 21 April. The updated statistics include two people who died at home and a third whose location of death was not specified. Previously, the first COVID-19 death in the county was thought to have occurred on 9 March.

The revised cause of death shows that the deadly disease had footholds in the United States earlier than previously thought. Similar reports have surfaced elsewhere in recent weeks. In late March, a non-peer-reviewed epidemiology study of the Lombardy region in northern Italy found that the virus might have been circulating there for more than a month before it was detected.

22 April 16:45 BST — Climate scientist and IPCC veteran dies of the coronavirus

John Houghton, a climate scientist and a senior member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), died of COVID-19 on 15 April, aged 88.

Houghton was the lead editor of the first three IPCC assessment reports — massive, influential studies that summarize the state of scientific knowledge on climate change — and accepted the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the organization, alongside former US vice-president Al Gore. Researchers who knew Houghton commended him for his scientific rigour, his leadership and his ability to connect with policymakers and the public.

After studying at the University of Oxford, UK, Houghton became a professor there in 1958. He was a pioneer in the use of emerging satellite technologies for understanding the Earth system. As the director-general of the UK Met Office, the nation’s weather agency, from 1983 to 1991, he helped to establish the Hadley Centre for Climate Science and Services in Exeter and advised the UK government on the scientific consensus on climate change. “He knew they could only really make progress if they had very clear and well-communicated scientific advice,” says Richard Betts, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter, who worked on several IPCC reports with Houghton.

Houghton’s lifetime of leadership in the climate-change community is a significant legacy, Betts says. “He wasn’t just a scientist. He was someone who cared passionately.”

A devout Christian, Houghton co-founded and led the John Ray Initiative, a charity in Gloucester, UK, focused on promoting environmental stewardship through both science and Christianity. He convinced a prominent US evangelical lobbyist of the compatibility of climate change and Christian thought in the early 2000s.

His former students remember him fondly. “John was an excellent leader,” says James Drummond, a retired atmospheric scientist who most recently worked at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Houghton supervised Drummond through his undergraduate and graduate studies at Oxford in the 1970s. “If I do a quarter of what he did, I will be doing very well,” says Drummond.

21 April 20:40 BST — 1,500 people volunteer for controversial vaccine-study approach

Momentum is building to speed the development of coronavirus vaccines by intentionally infecting healthy, young volunteers with the virus. A grass-roots effort has attracted nearly 1,500 potential volunteers for the controversial approach, known as a human-challenge trial.

The effort, called 1Day Sooner, is not affiliated with groups or companies developing or funding coronavirus vaccines. But co-founder Josh Morrison hopes to show that there is broad support for human-challenge trials, which have the potential to deliver an effective coronavirus vaccine more quickly than standard trials.

Typical vaccine trials take a long time because thousands of people receive either a vaccine or a placebo, and researchers track who becomes infected in the course of their daily lives. A challenge study could in theory be much faster: a much smaller group of volunteers would receive a candidate vaccine and then be intentionally infected with the virus, to judge the efficacy of the immunization.

“We want to recruit as many people as possible who want to do this, and pre-qualify them as likely to be able to participate in challenge trials should they occur,” says Morrison, who is also the executive director of organ-donation advocacy group Waitlist Zero. “At the same time, we feel that the public policy decisions around challenge trials will be better informed if they highlight the voice of people interested in participating in such trials.”

Morrison says that the people who have signed up to be part of a challenge trial tend to be young and live in urban areas, and are highly motivated to do something constructive to address the coronavirus pandemic. “Many note that they recognize the risk but believe the benefits of vaccine acceleration are so tremendous that it is worth it to them,” he says.

A team led by bioethicist Nir Eyal at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, argued that a human challenge trial could be conducted safely and ethically, in a paper in The Journal of Infectious Diseases last month.

The approach is also gaining some political support. This week, 35 members of the US Congress, led by Bill Foster (Democrat, Illinois) and Donna Shalala (Democrat, Florida), called on Department of Health and Human Services director Alex Azar to consider human-challenge trials of coronavirus vaccines.

Charlie Weller, head of the vaccines programme at Wellcome, a biomedical-research funder in London, says the charity has begun discussing the ethics and logistics of a human-challenge trial for a coronavirus vaccine. But she says it is unclear whether such a trial could actually speed vaccine development. Researchers first need to determine how to expose humans to the virus as safely as possible, and to consider how and even whether such studies can be done ethically. “I think there’s potential,” Weller adds, “but we’ve got so many questions to work through to understand whether it can help in the timelines we have.”

21 April 15:30 BST — Coronavirus brings forward Mars plans

The Arab world’s first Mars mission — a spacecraft called Hope — will ship from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Japan weeks earlier than planned, as a result of travel restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accelerating the shipment will mean that the probe, which will orbit the red planet and study the Martian atmosphere, will miss out on some planned tests. “We had to expedite activities in Dubai and basically focus only on the critical testing,” project leader Omran Sharaf told a virtual meeting of the Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group, a NASA-led international forum for planning Mars activities, on 17 April. “It got too risky for us if we waited,” he said.

Built by UAE and US engineers, the orbiter is scheduled to launch from Tanegashima Space Center in Japan in a window that starts on 15 July, when Earth and Mars are suitably aligned. The craft should reach Martian orbit in 2021.''',

    description:
        '''Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.

The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there was now a "very worrying increase in deaths, in most regions of the world" and it was "premature for any country either to surrender, or to declare victory".

Presentational white space
Asia

Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture with case numbers rising rapidly in some countries while falling sharply in others.

South Korea, Vietnam and Thailand are all experiencing their highest wave of infections since the start of the pandemic.

In contrast, India has seen its daily cases fall sharply, registering 2,000 cases per day on average. The country has now recorded more than 43 million cases in total - second only to the US. The official death toll in India is more than 521,000.

China has maintained a zero-Covid policy since the first outbreak in 2019, with harsh restrictions and widespread testing.

However it is facing a new spike in cases in the north-east of the country driven by the Omicron variant, with thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown.

Overall, China has reported more than 1.2 million cases and more than 12,000 coronavirus deaths - still much lower than the figures reported by other major nations despite the recent surge.''',
